# DevSecOps PoC

Enterprise-grade progressive deployment with dual-URL strategy for zero-risk canary releases and mandatory QA approval gates.

## What This Does

This PoC implements **always-available QA testing** with **progressive production rollouts**:

### The Dual-URL Strategy
- **Production URL** (http://poc-app.local) - Always shows stable version with progressive traffic shifting
- **QA URL** (http://poc-app-qa.local) - Always shows canary version for testing (never returns 503)

### The Improved Workflow
1. **Deploy canary with guaranteed pods** - Minimum 1 canary replica always running for QA
2. **QA tests immediately** - QA URL works instantly, no waiting for traffic shifts
3. **Progressive production rollout** - After QA approval: 0% → 10% → 20% → 50% → 100%
4. **Instant rollback** - Emergency rollback available at any stage

**Key Innovation**: QA URL is decoupled from production traffic weights - QA always gets 100% canary while production follows safe progressive rollout.

## Overview

This proof-of-concept addresses a critical organizational challenge: establishing a viable path to higher delivery velocity for legacy applications so they can participate in the DevSecOps world. Without this capability, organizations risk creating a bi-modal IT environment with modern systems receiving continuous security updates while core legacy systems accumulate vulnerabilities on unsupported software.

> "If the rate of change on the outside exceeds the rate of change on the inside, the end is near." - Jack Welch

DevSecOps enables security at the rate of change. This PoC demonstrates how ALL systems, including legacy applications lacking automated testing, can adopt progressive deployment patterns to:

- Increase delivery cadence to pay down technical debt
- Reduce vulnerability exposure windows
- Encourage incremental automation
- Enable gradual introduction of security and quality testing

### Key Capabilities

- **Always-Available QA Testing**: Guaranteed minimum 1 canary replica ensures QA URL never returns 503
- **Decoupled Traffic Control**: QA gets 100% canary traffic while production follows progressive weights
- **Manual Approval Gates**: Human validation required at each traffic increase (10% → 20% → 50% → 100%)
- **Security Integration**: Vulnerability scanning and SBOM generation without blocking deployment
- **Emergency Rollback**: Instant abort and undo capabilities at any stage

## Quick Start Guide

### 🎯 **The Magic of Dual-URL Strategy**

**Before Deployment:**
- Both URLs show the same stable version (GREEN background)

**After Canary Deployment:**
- **Production URL** (http://poc-app.local) - **GREEN** background (stable v1.0) → Progressive traffic to canary
- **QA URL** (http://poc-app-qa.local) - **AMBER** background (canary v1.1) → Always 100% canary

**Key Benefits:**
- ✅ **Zero 503 Errors**: QA URL works instantly after deployment
- ✅ **Independent Testing**: QA validates without affecting production
- ✅ **Safe Rollout**: Production traffic increases only after QA approval

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Setup

```bash
# Check prerequisites
make prerequisites

# Create cluster and install components
make setup

# Add hostnames to /etc/hosts
echo "127.0.0.1 poc-app.local poc-app-qa.local" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

### 2. Application Deployment

```bash
# Build and push application
make build

# Deploy to cluster
make deploy

# Verify deployment
make status
```

### 3. Test the Initial Deployment

**Step 1: Open the production URL in your browser**
- Go to: http://poc-app.local
- You should see a **GREEN** background with "STABLE RELEASE"

**Step 2: Verify the QA URL status**
- Go to: http://poc-app-qa.local
- Initially shows the stable version (GREEN) since no canary is deployed yet

### 4. Deploy a Canary Version (The Dual-URL Magic ✨)

**Step 1: Deploy version 1.1.0**
```bash
make deploy-canary VERSION=v1.1.0
```
**Result**: Canary deployed with guaranteed minimum 1 replica for QA

**Step 2: Verify canary deployment**
```bash
make qa-status
```
**Expected Output**: Shows canary pods running with role=canary labels

**Step 3: 🎯 QA Testing Phase (The Magic Moment)**
**Current state after deployment:**

| URL | Background | Version | Traffic | Purpose |
|-----|------------|---------|---------|---------|
| **Production** (poc-app.local) | 🟢 **GREEN** | v1.0 stable | 100% stable | Real users |
| **QA** (poc-app-qa.local) | 🟠 **AMBER** | v1.1 canary | 100% canary | QA testing |

- ✅ **No 503 errors**: QA URL works immediately
- ✅ **Zero production risk**: All production traffic stays on stable
- ✅ **Full QA access**: Complete canary environment for testing

**Step 4: Progressive Production Rollout (After QA Approval)**
```bash
make promote-10   # QA approves: 10% production → canary
make promote-20   # QA approves: 20% production → canary  
make promote-50   # QA approves: 50% production → canary
make promote-100  # QA final approval: 100% → canary becomes stable
```

**Step 5: Monitor after QA approval**
```bash
make dashboards  # Opens Grafana at http://localhost:3000 (admin/admin)
```

### 5. Complete the Rollout

After each promotion step, monitor metrics before proceeding:

```bash
make rollout-status  # Check current traffic distribution
```

Final state after 100% promotion:
- http://poc-app.local - Shows v1.1.0 **GREEN** (new stable)
- http://poc-app-qa.local - Shows v1.1.0 **GREEN** (awaiting next canary)

**Visual Indicators:**
- **GREEN background** = Stable/Production version
- **AMBER background** = Canary version (QA testing)
- **Traffic percentage** = Shown in rollout status

### 6. Test Auto-Rollback

**Deploy a bad version (v1.2.0 has 30% errors):**
```bash
make deploy-canary VERSION=v1.2.0
make promote-20  # Move to 20% - will auto-rollback when metrics fail

# Or emergency rollback:
make rollback
```

Watch it auto-rollback in ~2-3 minutes when metrics fail!

## Application Endpoints

| Endpoint | Purpose | Parameters |
|----------|---------|------------|
| `/health` | Health check | None |
| `/version` | Version information | None |
| `/work` | CPU load simulation | `?delay=100` (ms) |
| `/` | Status summary | None |

### Traffic Routing

**Dual-URL Strategy with Decoupled Routing**:
- **Production URL**: `http://poc-app.local` - Follows progressive traffic weights (0% → 10% → 20% → 50% → 100%)
- **QA URL**: `http://poc-app-qa.local` - Always routes to canary pods (100% canary traffic)

### Key Architecture Improvements

**1. Guaranteed Canary Availability:**
- `setCanaryScale: replicas: 1` ensures minimum 1 canary pod
- `scaleDownDelaySeconds: 600` keeps pods alive for 10 minutes
- No more 503 errors on QA URL

**2. Independent QA Testing:**
- QA URL bypasses traffic weight controls
- QA always gets 100% canary traffic
- Production traffic follows safe progressive rollout

**3. Progressive Traffic Shifting:**
```
Step 1: 0% production, 100% QA → Canary validation
Step 2: 10% production, 100% QA → Initial production exposure  
Step 3: 20% production, 100% QA → Increased confidence
Step 4: 50% production, 100% QA → Half production traffic
Step 5: 100% production → Full rollout complete
```

**Visual Indicators:**
- **GREEN background** = Stable/Production version
- **AMBER background** = Canary version (QA testing)
- **Traffic split** = Managed by Argo Rollouts progressively

## Monitoring and Observability

| `make rollout-status` | Show detailed rollout progress |

### Step-by-Step Promotion Workflow

**1. Deploy new canary version:**
```bash
make deploy-canary VERSION=v1.1.0
```

**2. Verify canary environment:**
```bash
make qa-status  # Shows canary pods and endpoints
make rollout-status  # Shows SetWeight: 0, ActualWeight: 0
```

**3. QA Validation Phase:**
- Production URL: http://poc-app.local - **GREEN** (100% stable v1.0)
- QA URL: http://poc-app-qa.local - **AMBER** (100% canary v1.1)
- Canary pods: Guaranteed minimum 1 replica running

**4. Progressive Production Rollout:**
```bash
make promote-10   # After QA approval: 10% production traffic
make promote-20   # Continue testing: 20% production traffic
make promote-50   # Increased confidence: 50% production traffic
make promote-100  # Full rollout: 100% production traffic
```

**5. Monitor throughout deployment:**
```bash
make dashboards     # Grafana metrics
make rollout-status # Current traffic distribution
```

**Each promotion step requires explicit QA approval!**
